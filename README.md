# Garrysmod Bloodsport #

An arena combat gamemode inspired by halo, unreal tournament and bad rats

Features:
- 9 different weapons to fight with, each one having both a primary and secondary fire
- Weapons and pickups that spawn around the arena
- Style based combo kills (eg you get much more points for a walljump midair headshot than a regular kill)
- An automated rounds and scoring system
- Some kind of basic parkour system, you can wall jump to get over the spikes and avoid attacks (and it can be used in skill combos)
- A custom made arena map to fight on
- Crowd cheering and music (may or may not work properly, source engine audio is pretty jank)

How 2 install:
- Place the gamemode in your gamemodes folder
- Place the map config into your data folder (for the default map)
- Unzip the content into the gamemode folder (should look like garrysmod/gamemodes/bloodsport/content) on both the server and your gmod install

How 2 set up a new map:
- Bloodsport has no particular map requirements and can run on any suitable map
- Use the commands bs_addweapon and bs_addloot to place pickup spawns around the map
- Use bs_clearpickups if you screw something up

Features that would have been in if i hadn't wasted so much time:
- Randomly generated mutators to spice up each round type
- More possible gametypes for each round
- Dynamic traps that activate and deactivate
- A consumable boost items system, eg you can buy a steroid pack or artillery beacon with the cash you gain from winning rounds
