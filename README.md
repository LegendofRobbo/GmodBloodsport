# Garrysmod Bloodsport #

An arena combat gamemode inspired by halo, unreal tournament and bad rats

Features:
- 9 different weapons to fight with, each one having both a primary and secondary fire
- Weapons and pickups that spawn around the arena
- Style based combo kills (eg you get much more points for a walljump midair headshot than a regular kill)
- An automated rounds and scoring system
- Some kind of basic parkour system, you can wall jump to get over the spikes and avoid attacks (and it can be used in skill combos)
- A custom made arena map to fight on
- Crowd cheering and music (may or may not work properly, source engine audio is pretty jank)

Features that would have been in if i hadn't wasted so much time:
- Randomly generated mutators to spice up each round type
- More possible gametypes for each round
- Dynamic traps that activate and deactivate
- A consumable boost items system, eg you can buy a steroid pack or artillery beacon with the cash you gain from winning rounds
